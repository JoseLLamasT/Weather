# Weather Forecast:

It is a small exercise where you can see the weather forecast in different locations, in real-time and also what the weather will be like for the next few hours or days.

The data was sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API, which is free and provides a good amount of data, including icons, temperature, wind speed, etc.

This app was built in more than 6 hours, which means there is a lot to improve, such as style, testing, the possibility to store locations that we are interested in. Additionally, it should be better to show the data in shorter periods because in three hours it can have significant changes.

If you want to improve or use this project, you must:
Download or clone it.
Open the project in any code editor, for example, Visual Studio Code.
Open terminal and go to the "my-app" folder namely 'weather-> client -> my-app' and run npm install in your terminal. This will install all the dependencies you will need.
Now you can run npm start, as a result, react will run on port http: //localhost: 3000, but if you are using that port, check-in your terminal which port react has selected (most likely http:// localhost :3001)
